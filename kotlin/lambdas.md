#__Lambda__

This is like treat a function as a value, that can we pass in function parameter.  
and this funciton some time did not require to define seprately and pass as a block of code.

```Java

// Non lambda code  
button.setOnClickListner(new OnClickListner () {
    public onClick(){
	/* do Something */
    }
}

// Lambda code  

button.setOnClickListner{ /* code */}

```

see how small and readable code is, this is a substitue of anonymous classes.
